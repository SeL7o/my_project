Olga Romanova,"I've used the app for years and was a loyal customer untill booking stopped to show the full price of the properties. For example you see attractive price of a property, open the page and all looks good untill you move to the payment and you see absolutely different picture: tons of fees (cleaning, property, variety of taxes and so on). So you have to open every property to figure out the price and spend a lot of time to find something according your budget. So I started to use Expedia.",9.5,2.0,88.5,79.06,positive

Booking had it correct, but even after speaking to the manager over the phone to confirm, (since they never replied to the email sent through booking), when I arrived, they had cancelled the original but never reserved one for the new date. Booking took care of everything and it wasnt more than a 20 minute delay. This is the third time tbey've come to my rescue. Grateful!",17.2,5.3,77.5,92.30000000000001,positive

I had no problems until I had to cancel a trip due to work and they were very unhelpful. Would not recommend. Not only did they charge me cancellation fees they also had me contact the airline directly to cancel my flight.

Pauline Ward,V good very useful app. But i wish they made it more clear when you have not booked breakfast. The select rooms page shoukd display the info more clearly just say 'no breakfast' very prominently on those rooms that dont include it. Because sometimes you just have to settle for a room thats within the right distance of your destination. But then after you do the reservation you want to check whether you need to organise your own breakfast or whether you can decide nearer the time.,17.5,2.9000000000000004,79.60000000000001,91.97,positive

I used to think that it was worth it because I had protections but booking is pretty poor in service if you have bad or unsafe experiences. The genius benefits are not useful. I also find the rating system obfuscates big problems by weighting small things as the same as large. You pretty much can't trust anything lower than 9.5 as a result.,15.2,17.4,67.4,-53.15,negative

I've also seen that the hotel has 2 different entries, and I told that to the customer support, but they refused to help me and they insisted to assume that the hotel was telling the truth about my stay! So overall, even if the platform is good if you're lucky, if you're in need of the Customer Support, I'm already feeling bad for you. Hope for the platform to revise some of their customer support policies, because this is truly unacceptable!!

I can add only 4 photos for review through mobile app. But most of the times I have around 7-8 photos to share in property review, so people will get better picture about property.

Too much to look at on the app. If people want to learn about the amenities, make a different tab for that. Instead of throwing a bunch of useless stuff in their face. I wanted a nice hotel room, with a pool. Then if you dont LOOK for it it won't tell you but you'll get charged a security deposit.

You don't even know until you check in. Same way with smoking rooms just recently booked with a motel & clicked on smoking room then found out it wasn't one. How are you to know? This can cause you to get charged. Need a checklist for motel to see needs. Then a message so you know they see your requests.,5.7,7.199999999999999,87.1,-12.8,negative

Then it turns out that Booking takes money for nothing as you are on your own. I got offerer $20 voucher for a ruined evening and night where after all day of traveling I had to look for another accommodation arrangements. Just call any hotel on booking directly and they will happily give you 20% off price than on the website.,11.5,7.000000000000001,81.39999999999999,61.24000000000001,positive

Vidjit Vijaysanker,They gave me a travel credit which cannot be used anywhere. Why give rewards which cannot be used. Won't the customer feel cheated. Please refrain from such cheap rewarding techniques. Also booking most hotels is much cheaper using the hotels own site. Here the rates are hiked and then they give discounts. If there is a discount then you might miss your complimentary breakfast. Use this app only to search for properties.

Thandeka Setenate,in October I made a booking on this app for a December holiday. today I decided to scroll on my booking as i landed on a recent review saying that the person discovered that the place is not real and the host uses information of another place as their own. i find this true because i've been trying to reach out to the host but they're not reachable. i don't know what steps to take to get refunded or at least be allocated to another place since this place is a scam. customer service isn't helping.,5.3,7.8,86.9,-65.5,negative

You arrive at the location of your booking, the rooms are not at all like advertised, it smells like urine, you take photos of the room's condition and, after a very long drive, leave the property with your wife and two kids looking for options in the middle of the night. You call booking 5 times during the week with 20+ mins of waiting, they tell you the property will not refund and also you cannot leave a review for the property since you didn't stay there. Of course you didn't stay, it was horrible! Every time the support at Booking tells you how sorry they are, they see the pictures you've sent, agree that it doesn't look at all like promised and... nothing :) So you end up with lost time, lost money and no possibility to review so that others can avoid the property.

After I finished the booking and money got out of my account I got an email saying they couldn't confirm the booking, they initiated the refund and I should try again. Okay, no big deal. Probably just some tech glitch, that happens so I did the booking again. It charged my card again and i got the same email saying they couldn't confirm the booking and they will refund me. I contacted their customer support, asking what's going on and what should I do to actually book the hotel. I sent them the hotel name and the payment reference number for both attempted booking. They responded with email asking for a Booking confirmation number (I stated I don't have any since the booking wasn't confirmed) and dates of my stay (which again, there were none since the booking was never successfully created). After some back and forth, the only thing they told me was to check my spam folder and to expect the refund in 12 days.

Islam Faress,Booking is a SCAM is working with scamming hotels. I called and emailed them 3 weeks in advance to confirm that there is airconditioning. Every time the hotel confirmed that there is air conditioning. As I arrived I asked again and the receptionist lied to me and said there is airconditioning. After I paid the city tax and went to check the room there was no airconditioning. And then the receptionist told me it under construction and there is no airconditioning.

Lori Pickett,Information is clear and app is EASY TO USE. So far just one issue that I don't care for. Getting a hold of a Customer Service Rep. I needed information about something other then my bookings and wasn't able to talk to anyone online nor the phone. Needing a past or current bookings confirmation number just to be transfered to customer care. Why do I need ANYTHING like that especially about a completely unrelated issue. Issue and question was never resolved which lead to more questions...?? 🥴,11.700000000000001,7.6,80.7,56.02,positive

Andrew Casey,Terrible experience this week. Was sent an email from Booking com for a hotel night at Manchester Airport in April 2023. I was sent details and photos of Holiday Inn £99. Went to book it immediately: the same room and date was not £99 but £149. A trick. I called Holiday In and they said there never was a £99 room. I called customer service and they were rubbish. No manager or anyway to escalate my complain. I will close my account shortly,6.4,11.1,82.5,-45.879999999999995,negative
Matteo Natale,Apart from the other problems I had years ago. Last unbelievable issue was that they charged me for a room they couldn't booked. Then they refund me less than what they deducted me.

A Google user,Unfortunately my experience using this website was not a positive one. I had to travel for work purposes. So I booked through this website. What was advertised as a hostel. Once I arrived at the property I realised that it was a private home. I knocked on the door. There was no answer. I called the contact number that was advertised as the contact number for this property. Someone answered but when I said hello they hung up. Then to my disgust I was told by your company that I would not be able to get my money back. Between travel cost and cost of my training fees I'm now £700 out of pocket. I will never trust or book with this company again.,1.9,11.799999999999999,86.3,-91.64,negative
