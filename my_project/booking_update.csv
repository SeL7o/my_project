Olga Romanova,"I've used the app for years and was a loyal customer untill booking stopped to show the full price of the properties. For example you see attractive price of a property, open the page and all looks good untill you move to the payment and you see absolutely different picture: tons of fees (cleaning, property, variety of taxes and so on). So you have to open every property to figure out the price and spend a lot of time to find something according your budget. So I started to use Expedia.",9.5,2.0,88.5,79.06,positive

Booking had it correct, but even after speaking to the manager over the phone to confirm, (since they never replied to the email sent through booking), when I arrived, they had cancelled the original but never reserved one for the new date. Booking took care of everything and it wasnt more than a 20 minute delay. This is the third time tbey've come to my rescue. Grateful!",17.2,5.3,77.5,92.30000000000001,positive

I had no problems until I had to cancel a trip due to work and they were very unhelpful. Would not recommend. Not only did they charge me cancellation fees they also had me contact the airline directly to cancel my flight.

Pauline Ward,V good very useful app. But i wish they made it more clear when you have not booked breakfast. The select rooms page shoukd display the info more clearly just say 'no breakfast' very prominently on those rooms that dont include it. Because sometimes you just have to settle for a room thats within the right distance of your destination. But then after you do the reservation you want to check whether you need to organise your own breakfast or whether you can decide nearer the time.,17.5,2.9000000000000004,79.60000000000001,91.97,positive

Stine W,I travel almost full time and used to use booking but then I often find the booking rate is often 25% more expensive than the hotel's website. I used to think that it was worth it because I had protections but booking is pretty poor in service if you have bad or unsafe experiences. The genius benefits are not useful. I also find the rating system obfuscates big problems by weighting small things as the same as large. You pretty much can't trust anything lower than 9.5 as a result.,15.2,17.4,67.4,-53.15,negative

After a lot of hassle, I just gave up as the app wouldn't accept the receipt from the other b&b. Booking never responded again after the initial contact & I ended up paying double for another b&b.

johan hanekom,A few problems arose yesterday with a booking I made 1) The place marked on the map is not where the actual place was. Also it is tedious because there is no link to Google maps/gps 2) The place I booked did not honor my booking. I subsequently tried to contact your customer centre. But that is so unaccessible and user unfriendly. Eventually I phoned only to be told that no operators are available. 3) That left me stranded without accommodation.

Of course you didn't stay, it was horrible!

Marek TakÃ¡Ä,"I am not sure what's going on with this app lately. I was using Booking (web and app) for years and I was always more less satisfied, but my last booking and subsequent contact with their customer service was just awful. I tried to book a hotel in Barcelona for a few days for ~600 euros. After I finished the booking and money got out of my account I got an email saying they couldn't confirm the booking, they initiated the refund and I should try again. Okay, no big deal. Probably just some tech glitch, that happens so I did the booking again. It charged my card again and i got the same email saying they couldn't confirm the booking and they will refund me. I contacted their customer support, asking what's going on and what should I do to actually book the hotel. I sent them the hotel name and the payment reference number for both attempted booking. They responded with email asking for a Booking confirmation number (I stated I don't have any since the booking wasn't confirmed) and dates of my stay (which again, there were none since the booking was never successfully created). After some back and forth, the only thing they told me was to check my spam folder and to expect the refund in 12 days. To summarise: I still don't have the booking, I don't have 1200 euros I paid for the booking that was never confirmed and I don't have any meaningful response from the customer support regarding what should I do to actually book the hotel.",5.4,7.3999999999999995,87.3,-74.86,negative

I called the contact number that was advertised as the contact number for this property. Someone answered but when I said hello they hung up. Then to my disgust I was told by your company that I would not be able to get my money back. Between travel cost and cost of my training fees I'm now Â£700 out of pocket.
